# ECG Analysis App

This is a React Native application that provides a simple and user-friendly interface to upload or take a photo of an ECG chart. The app sends the ECG image to a server for processing using a machine learning model. It then displays whether the ECG is predicted as healthy or unhealthy, and provides information on nearby cardiologists for consultation if required.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Before starting the Metro Server and running your application, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn
```

This will install all the required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### Step 2: Start the Metro Server

After installing dependencies, start **Metro**, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 3: Start your Application

Keep Metro Bundler running in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project and run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If set up correctly, your app should start running on your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly.

### Step 4: Modifying your App

Once the app is running, you can modify it:

1. Open `App.tsx` (or `App.js` if using JavaScript) in your text editor of choice and make changes.
2. For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux, or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes.
3. For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes.

## Using the ECG Analysis Feature

1. **Upload/Take Photo**: Use the app to either upload an existing ECG chart photo from your device's gallery or take a new photo using the camera.
2. **Processing**: The app sends the ECG image to our server for processing using a machine learning model.
3. **Result**: Once processed, the app displays whether the ECG is predicted as healthy or unhealthy.
4. **Consultation**: If the ECG result indicates a potential issue, the app provides information on nearby cardiologists for consultation.
